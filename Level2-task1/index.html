                <H1>Mahatma Karamchand Gandhi</H1>
                <p> India, was a leader in India's struggle for independence against British rule. Known for his
                    philosophy of nonviolent resistance (Satyagraha), he led campaigns for civil rights and social
                    reform. Gandhi played a pivotal role in India's independence in 1947 but was tragically assassinated
                    on January 30, 1948. His legacy emphasizes nonviolence, truth, and social equality, influencing
                    civil rights movements globally. Gandhi's birthday is observed as the International Day of
                    Non-Violence.</p>
